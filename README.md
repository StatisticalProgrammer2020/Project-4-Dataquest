# DQ R-Project 4: Analyzing Forest Fires
This is my fourth project in Dataquest towards my journey in R Programming. This project aims to identify possible factors which lead to the occurrence of forest fires in Portugal. In this project, the following concepts are used to achieve the given problem:
+ Barplots
+ Scatterplots
+ Multiple charting

# Data source

The source of the dataset can be accessed here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/

This dataset contains 517 rows and 13 columns.

# Variables

Here are the following variables that were used in the analysis:
+ X: X-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
+ Y: Y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
+ month: Month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
+ day: Day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
+ FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
+ DMC: Duff Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
+ DC: Drought Code index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
+ ISI: Initial Spread Index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
+ temp: Temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
+ RH: Relative humidity in percentage: 15.0 to 100
+ wind: Wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
+ rain: Outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
+ area: The burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84
